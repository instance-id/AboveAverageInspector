# AboveAverageInspector
A custom inspector drawer, because I wanted something I could organize into groups

### NOTE : Above-Average Inspector is a work in progress! 

While the majority of the functionality is present, there more assuredly are still bugs.  
(Known-Issue: Currently, the List items [ + ] Add and [ - ] Remove buttons are not working properly)

### Categorize your fields
Use the ```[UICategory(name:"", order:0, expand:true)]``` attribute to draw your field in a category, order the categories, and decide if you want the category expanded by default.

Uncategorized fields are automatically placed in a "Default" category.
